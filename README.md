REFACTORING AN EXISTING SITE

Motivation: To refactor an existing webpage for clairty and accessibility.

In order to refactor the site, I created alt descriptions for the photographs on the website. In addition,
I edited the css to eliminate the redundancies in the text, creating cleaner coding. And finally I added
@media breakpoint instructions in the css text.
